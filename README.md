# LACKYVPN# LACKYVPN - Operator-Class Privacy Framework

```
🔥 Built by Lackadaisical Security - Sealed with 10-layer fire 🔥
```

## Overview

LACKYVPN is an operator-class privacy framework that provides military-grade anonymity through a 10-layer quad-encryption tunnel around OpenVPN, complete system hardening, traffic obfuscation, and anti-analysis protection.

## Features

- **System Hardening**: Pre-VPN launch security lockdown
- **10-Layer Quad-Encryption**: Classical, Quantum, Quantum-Resistant, and Quantum-Safe algorithms
- **Ghost Engine**: Advanced traffic obfuscation and pattern masking
- **Zero-Trust Authentication**: 2FA + FIDO2 + biometric fallback
- **Anti-Analysis Defense**: Binary mutation, VM detection, self-wiping
- **Distress Mode**: UI camouflage and evidence elimination
- **Runtime Monitoring**: DNS leak detection, MITM anomaly logging
